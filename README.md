Trying to bring some transparency to the prices of MTGA.

## Notes
- All tables can be sorted by clicking on the column header.
- I urge you to use [17lands](https://www.17lands.com/) or some other tracker to get an accurate value for winrate. I cannot be held responsible if you misreport your own winrates!
- Packs are not given a monetary value. Part of that is because you can't exchange cards/packs for anything, and you can't enter events with cards/wildcards/packs; part of that is because it's just so tricky to come up with a fair calculation, seeing as collection value depends on how much of the set you already possess and how much of it you plan on using in the future. I'm confident that packs are **not** worth their full gem price, however, unless you were already planning on spending gems to buy packs directly. It's like that saying, "A car loses half its value the moment you drive off the lot with it."
- More events will be added in the future as they come accross my radar! I only started playing MTGA again 20 days before the release of this dashboard.
